# GameMaker Modding Docs Generatir
 A GitHub pages documentation generator for GameMaker games (FOR MODDERS, NOT DEVELOPERS)  
## Please note
This was made for the game "Will You Snail", and you may need to modify some code to get it to work.  
Documentation for how to format the "manual overrides" will be added soon. These are important because argument names can't be decompiled when modding GM games.  
Loosely based on [namethempguy's GMEdit dialect generator](https://github.com/Name2781/GMEditDialectGen)
